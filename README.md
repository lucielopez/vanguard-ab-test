**Vanguard A/B Test**
Project 5 


Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of a new digital interface (UI) for Vanguard customers using A/B testing.
We explored whether the Test version improves completion rates, session duration, group age and error rates across different user segments.
All analysis, visualizations, and dashboards were created by the project team (Velia and me).
